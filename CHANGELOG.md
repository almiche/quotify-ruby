## V0.3.0
Introduction quotify CLI. Pretty barebone implementation with update method. `quotify update` or `quotify u` updates the database.

## V0.2.0
Saves the quotes in memory to prevent too many IO operations. Added configs that can be updated at runtime. `quotes.yml` only works with symbols as keys. From now on, prioritize symbols over strings. A new field `updated_at` was added to `quotes.yml` to allow for updating quotes using gem command. This will be added in the future.

## V0.1.1
Fixes documentations formatting. No additional features were added.

## V0.1.0
